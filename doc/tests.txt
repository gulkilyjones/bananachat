Here’s a detailed **QA testing checklist** for thoroughly testing `server.py` and its associated functionality:

---

### **Functional Testing**
1. **Startup and Shutdown**:
   - Verify the server starts successfully on the default port (`8000`) without errors.
   - Test starting the server on a custom port using `--port` argument.
   - Validate proper error messages for invalid port inputs (e.g., negative values, strings, or ports out of range).
   - Ensure the server shuts down gracefully on `Ctrl+C`.

2. **Homepage Accessibility**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:<port>` and verify that the chat interface (`chat_interface.html`) loads correctly.
   - Confirm the server returns a 404 error for invalid routes.

3. **Message Submission**:
   - Submit a valid message through the chat interface.
   - Verify the message is saved as a `.txt` file in the `messages` directory.
   - Check that the message appears immediately on the chat interface after submission.

4. **File Handling**:
   - Test the handling of multiple messages:
     - Verify messages are stored sequentially (`message1.txt`, `message2.txt`, etc.).
     - Ensure no overwrites or data loss occur.
   - Test for invalid file inputs (e.g., non-text files in the `messages` directory) and confirm they don’t break the interface.

5. **HTML Regeneration**:
   - Ensure the `chat_interface.html` is updated dynamically after each new message.
   - Verify the proper rendering of special characters (e.g., `<, >, &, "`) in messages.

---

### **UI/UX Testing**
6. **Interface Functionality**:
   - Validate that the form accepts input only when required fields are filled.
   - Test the placeholder text and form submission button behavior.
   - Verify that the UI aligns properly on various screen sizes and resolutions.

7. **Message Formatting**:
   - Confirm sender/receiver message styling is applied correctly based on naming rules (e.g., vowel-based differentiation).
   - Ensure no style overlap or inconsistencies for long or multi-line messages.

---

### **Edge Case Testing**
8. **Message Content**:
   - Submit very long messages and verify they are stored and displayed correctly.
   - Test submission of empty messages and confirm they are rejected with an appropriate error.
   - Input non-standard characters or emojis to ensure proper handling and display.

9. **Concurrent Users**:
   - Simulate multiple users submitting messages simultaneously.
   - Verify messages are saved and displayed in the correct order without conflicts.

10. **Directory Validation**:
    - Delete the `messages` directory before starting the server. Confirm it is recreated automatically.
    - Verify behavior when the directory is set to read-only.

---

### **Security Testing**
11. **Injection Attacks**:
    - Submit messages containing HTML or JavaScript (e.g., `<script>alert('test')</script>`).
    - Ensure the content is properly escaped and no malicious scripts are executed.

12. **Unauthorized Access**:
    - Confirm no sensitive server details are exposed in the response headers or body.
    - Verify the server doesn’t allow unauthorized file access via URL manipulation (e.g., `http://localhost:<port>/../server.py`).

---

### **Performance Testing**
13. **Load Testing**:
    - Simulate high traffic by submitting a large number of messages.
    - Confirm the server remains responsive and no data loss occurs.

14. **Scalability**:
    - Increase the size of the `messages` directory significantly and test the time taken to load the chat interface.

---

### **Compatibility Testing**
15. **Browser Compatibility**:
    - Test the chat interface on multiple browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
    - Verify consistent behavior and UI appearance.

16. **Environment Compatibility**:
    - Run the server on different operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux) and confirm functionality.

---

### **Negative Testing**
17. **Invalid Requests**:
    - Send malformed HTTP requests (e.g., unsupported methods like `PUT`, malformed headers).
    - Confirm the server handles these gracefully without crashing.

18. **Invalid Message Data**:
    - Submit messages with only whitespace or unsupported encodings.
    - Ensure appropriate validation and error handling.

---

### **Regression Testing**
19. **Cross-Feature Validation**:
    - Modify `styles.css` and verify the chat interface reflects the updated styles.
    - Update the `generate_chat_html()` logic and confirm the changes propagate correctly to the interface.

---

### **Documentation Validation**
20. **Help and Usage**:
    - Run `python3 server.py --help` and confirm the displayed instructions are accurate and clear.
